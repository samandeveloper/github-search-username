## github-search-username App:
#### 1. The app's frontend is built using React.
#### 2. Accessing the app's dashboard requires user login or signup.
#### 3. I employ Auth0 for secure login/signup and authentication, supporting email and Google accounts.
#### 4. On the dashboard page, users can search for a person's GitHub username to view their GitHub report.
#### 5. The app allows up to 60 GitHub username requests per hour.
